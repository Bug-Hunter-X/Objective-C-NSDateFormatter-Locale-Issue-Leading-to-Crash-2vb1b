In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error arises when dealing with `NSDateFormatter` and locale settings.  Consider this scenario: you're parsing dates from a user's input, and the user's device is set to a locale that uses a different date format than your app expects (e.g.,  'MM/dd/yyyy' vs 'dd/MM/yyyy'). If your `NSDateFormatter` isn't explicitly configured with a `locale` property, it will default to the device's current locale. This can lead to incorrect date parsing, resulting in unexpected behavior or crashes if the date is not in the format expected by the formatter.
